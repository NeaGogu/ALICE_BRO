Alice has fallen into the White Rabbit’s hole - and now reality is going crazy! Help her figure out who’s at the bottom of all this. 

Thank you for trying our game! It was our first time touching game development and we had a ton of fun (and frustrating moments).  The game is missing some parts but the core of it is there. Enjoy! :)
